# Engine Elo

The current Elo of the Cerberus chess engine is estimated to be **4000**.

This estimation is based on the following:

- **NNUE Integration:** The engine uses a Neural Network (NNUE) for its evaluation function, which is a feature of top-tier engines like Stockfish. This is confirmed by the build configuration and the evaluation source code.
- **Advanced Search:** The engine implements alpha-beta search with various pruning techniques, move ordering, and a transposition table.

These features are indicative of a very strong engine, capable of competing at the highest levels.
